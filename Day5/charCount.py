searchStr = "Python is a great programming language"

"iterate over a string to find an count a character"

# we set count to the value of zero

# loop through the entire string to search for the character entered

    # check if the character entered is a match with any character in the string
        # increase the count by 1 every time you find the same character

  # display the result


# Exercise: refactor the code above by putting it into a subroutine and invoke it
